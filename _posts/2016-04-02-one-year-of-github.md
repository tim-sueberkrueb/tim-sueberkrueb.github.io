Wow, that went fast! It was exactly one year ago when I created my GitHub account and started contributing to the Open Source world. I think it's time to do a quick recap (or create a blog about it :D).

## The Liri Journey
At the very beginning of last year, I stumbled across the [Papyros Project][papyros-io], an effort to create an Material Design Linux OS on top of Arch Linux using modern technologies like Qt 5 and Wayland. Well, I fell in love with it :) Inspired by concepts of the associated [Papyros Google+ community][papyros-gpluscommunity], I started experimenting and created a fairly simple webbrowser application, written in pure QML.
Looking back from today, it was actually looking really crappy and didn't follow Material Design at all! Despite that fact, luckily, the community was very welcoming and motivating when I posted it. So I continued hacking on it.

[Pierre][pierre-com], who had created his own browser concept on the very beginning of 2015, joined development and together everything went a lot faster (and made a lot more fun!).
We decided to rename the browser, formerly simply called "Material Browser", to "Liri Browser" which was a great suggestion from [Christoph Laier][christoph-laier-gplus]. "Liri" is the Albanian word for freedom and we found it was quite fitting and sounded nice.

Over time the project evolved and what started as a very simple experiment became a quite usable alpha-state browser.
People where starting to test it, filing bugs against the GitHub repository and sending pull requests. This was very new to me at the beginning and I was very excited when people contributed to the project.

But the Liri story didn't end with the browser. It was later that year, when [Nick Germaine][nickgermaine-gh] started working on Liri Vinyl (now called Liri Music), an Material Design Music application and joined the project. Not much later, we welcomed [Andrew Penkrat][aldrog-gh] to the project, who is developing Liri Text, a Material Design text editor. Amazing contributions also came from [Michael Spencer][ibeliever-gh], the lead developer of Papyros. Just recently [Zachary Grafton][zacharygrafton-gh] and [Jean-Nicolas Moal][minicalion-gh] joined the team and started working on Liri Music.
When I started Material Browser I would never have dreamed that this experiment would grow to a team of seven really nice people. It's very cool to be part of this.

## Ubuntu Hangups
I have been using my Ubuntu phone as my main phone for about a year now and I still love it! Back in September 2015, I published [Ubuntu Hangups][ubuntu-hangups-gh], an unofficial Google Hangouts client based on Tom [Dryer][tdryer-gh]'s awesome Python library [Hangups][hangups-gh].

## There is more
* With [Quey UI][quey-ui-ghio] I started working on my own QML toolkit for cross-platform user interface creation.
* I created [a simple stopwatch app][asteroid-stopwatch-gh] for [Asteroid OS][asteroidos-org], an amazing open-source operating system for smartwatches. I still really enjoy following it's development and playing with my G Watch when I find the time.
* [MyGUS][mygus-gh] is an application created for my school which makes it easier for students to view their timetable and gives quick access to other school-related services.
* [SlimeEngine][slimeengine-gh] is an (not yet integrated) approach to clean up Liri Browser's backend.

... and there is even more yet waiting to be released :)

## What I Learned
* got familiar with Qt/QML and related libraries (qml-material, Ubuntu toolkits, PyOtherSide).
* improved my skills in my favourite programming language, Python
* did some web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* learned some C++
* learned some Java

I also realized one thing: open source is bringing people together. Over the last year, I came to talk with many great people from all over the world and I really enjoy this connections!

## What to Improve
* stick to coding conventions, improve code quality
* gain more C++ knowledge
* improve Java skills
* learn at least one new programming language or framework

... and just go on :)

To sum it up, this has been a fantastic first year on GitHub. I learned a lot of new stuff,
came to talk with several nice people, and had a lot of fun. I'm really looking forward to next year's episode!
